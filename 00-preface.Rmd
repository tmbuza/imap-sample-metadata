# Understanding Sample Metadata

## What is metadata?
- **Metadata** is a set of data that describes and provides information about other data. It is commonly defined as *data about data*.
- **Sample metadata** described here refers to the description and context of the individual sample collected for a specific microbiome study.

## Metadata structure
- Metadata collected at different stages are typically organized in an Excel or Google spreadsheet where:
  - The metadata table columns represent the properties of the samples.
  - The table rows contain information associated with the samples.
  - Typically, the first column of sample metadata is Sample ID, which designates the key associated with individual samples.
  - Sample ID must be unique.

## Embedded metadata
- In most cases, you will find the metadata detached from the experimental data.
- Embedded metadata integrates the experimental data, especially for graphics.
- Major microbiome analysis platforms require sample metadata, commonly referred to as a **mapping file** when performing downstream analysis.
