## Read size
The size of the reads can tell us how big is the dataset and can help to estimate the computational needs.

Top five smallest project by read size
```{r}
read_csv("results/read_size_asc.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) %>% 
head(5)
```

Top five biggest project by read size
```{r}
read_csv("results/read_size_desc.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) %>% 
head(5)
