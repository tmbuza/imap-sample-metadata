## Read size
The size of the reads can tell us how big is the dataset and can help to estimate the computational needs.

Top five smallest project by read size
```{r}
read_csv("results/read_size_asc.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) %>% 
head(5)
```

Top five biggest project by read size
```{r}
read_csv("results/read_size_desc.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) %>% 
head(5)
```

## Interactive Sample GPS Map

Dropping pins on the map is possible if you have coordinate data, such as latitudes and longitudes of collection points. The pins represent different projects, and by hovering over a pin, you will be able to see information about the corresponding project.

Below is the interactive map:
